# data_analysis_projects
These projects are just for my daily exercise and project experience.


To Note :
Data for these projects are from kaggle so even if you download any python file please do get the dataframe from kaggle or the path which is mentioned in pd.read_csv('path').  You can run these file through kaggle by just clicking the kaggle button at top of the notebook.
